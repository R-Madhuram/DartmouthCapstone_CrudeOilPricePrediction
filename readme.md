# **Exploration of Machine Learning Techniques to Predict Crude Oil Price**

## **Presentation and Demo Video (00h:20m:38s):**

## **Problem Statement and purpose:**
Crude oil a.k.a “Industrial Blood” is the largest traded commodity in the world accounting to ~10% of the world traded commodities (1) . Hence, any fluctuations in crude oil price impacts the national and global economy (2). 

Therefore, it is of great importance to investors, businesses, economists and political to be bale to predict the crude-oil price data to build resilience in the economic and energy domains in the national and global scale. 

## **Problem-Solving Frame work:**
We chose machine learning as our problem solving frame work. The typical workflow for ML framework consisting Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) was utilized to define the problem, map the system as time series forecasting ML task, define suitable error metrics, choose suitable ML methods and time the parameters with appropriate values to evaluate the model and the forecasting product before deploying it.
